# Glasses

A TUI logviewer based on the Textual library. Trying to combine making a useful tool and getting to learn the textual library.

## Installation

```
poetry install
python -m glasses.app
```

This tool makes use of the `config` file located in your `.kube` folder (don't know whether this is also the location when running on mac or windows) to get the available namespaces. It also assumes you are logged into your openshift namespace.



## todo:

A lot of things. This needs some serious refactoring still. PR's are welcome !
